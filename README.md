### I am thrilled to present my Angular 14 application project, showcasing my eagerness to learn and grow. Throughout this project, I immersed myself in the world of NgRx for state management, specifically focusing on the powerful Redux Store. By leveraging NgRx, I gained invaluable insights into centralized state management, predictable changes, efficient selectors, and the scalability of my application. This project allowed me to enhance my skills, create robust applications, and fuel my passion for continuous learning. Join me on this exciting journey of exploration and unleash the full potential of NgRx in Angular 14.
